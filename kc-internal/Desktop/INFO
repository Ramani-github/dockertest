This is a very similar XFCE Remote Desktop environment like provided in
the real exam. You can only copy from the questions on the left, you're
not able to copy other content from your local OS.

# K8s Docs
You'll need to use the Firefox browser inside the Remote Desktop to
open the K8s docs.

# Copy&Paste
Copy&Paste in Terminal: Ctrl+Shift+c Ctrl+Shift+v
Copy&Paste elsewhere: Ctrl+c Ctrl+v
Copy&Paste is also possible using mouse-right context menu

# Lagging
You'll probably experience lagging, like when moving windows or scrolling
in Firefox. Better get used to it now than during your real exam.

# Notepad
Use Application->Accessories->Mousepad to write down notes for yourself during
the exam.

# Visual Editor and Filesystems
In the real exam you will not be able to edit files using Mousepad and then
use these in the Terminal. This is because the Terminal will access a
different host than the Remote Desktop in the real exams. You could edit
text in Mousepad and then copy&paste it into vim inside the Terminal.

# Terminal Copy&Paste shows "Warning: Unsafe Paste"
Disable this at "Terminal Preferences->General->Show unsafe paste dialog".
